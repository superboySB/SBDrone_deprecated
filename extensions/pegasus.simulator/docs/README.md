# Pegasus Simulator

Pegasus Simulator is a framework built on top of NVIDIA
Omniverse and Isaac
Sim. It is designed to provide an easy, yet powerfull way of simulating the dynamics of vehicles. It provides a simulation interface for PX4 integration as well as a custom python control interface. At the moment, only multirotor vehicles are supported, with support for other vehicle topologies planned for future versions.

## Contributing

The developers of the Pegasus simulator welcome any positive contributions and ideas from the robotics comunity to make
in order to allow this extension to mature. If you think you have a nice contribution to make or just a simple suggestion,
feel free to create bug reports, feature requests or open pull requests for direct code contributions.

## Main Developer Team

This simulation framework is an open-source effort, started by me, Marcelo Jacinto in January/2023. It is a tool that was created with the original purpose of serving my Ph.D. workplan for the next 4 years, which means that you can expect this repository to be mantained, hopefully at least until 2027.
