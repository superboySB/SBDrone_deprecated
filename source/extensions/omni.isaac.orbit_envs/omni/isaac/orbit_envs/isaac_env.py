    Each observation from the environment is a batch of observations for each sub-
    environments. The method :meth:`step` is also expected to receive a batch of actions

    While the environment itself is implemented as a vectorized environment, we do not
    inherit from :class:`gym.vector.VectorEnv`. This is mainly because the class adds
    various methods (for wait and asynchronous updates) which are not required.
    Additionally, each RL library typically has its own definition for a vectorized
    environment. Thus, to reduce complexity, we directly use the :class:`gym.Env` over
    here and leave it up to library-defined wrappers to take care of wrapping this
