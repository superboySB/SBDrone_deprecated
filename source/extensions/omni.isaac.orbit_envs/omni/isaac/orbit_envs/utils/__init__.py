    The checkpoint file is resolved as: <log_path>/<run_dir>/<checkpoint>.

    Args:
        log_path (str): The log directory path to find models in.
        run_dir (int, optional): The name of the directory containing the run. Defaults to the most
            recent directory created inside :obj:`log_dir`.
        checkpoint (str, optional): The model checkpoint file or directory name. Defaults to the most recent

    Raises:
        ValueError: When no runs are found in the input directory.

    Returns:
        str: The path to the model checkpoint.
