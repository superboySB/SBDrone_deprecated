    PhysX 5 supports GPU-accelerated physics simulation. This is enabled by default, but can be disabled
    through the flag `use_gpu`. Unlike CPU PhysX, the GPU simulation feature is not able to dynamically
    grow all the buffers. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the buffer sizes
    for GPU features. If insufficient buffer sizes are provided, the simulation will fail with errors and
    lead to adverse behaviors. The buffer sizes can be adjusted through the `gpu_*` parameters.

    This flag allows performing collision queries (raycasts, sweeps, and overlaps) on actors and

    If set to False, the physics engine does not create the scene query manager and the scene query
    functionality will not be available. However, this provides some performance speed-up.
