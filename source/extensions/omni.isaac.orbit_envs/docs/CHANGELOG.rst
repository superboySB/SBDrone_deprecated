Changelog
---------

0.3.0 (2023-04-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
^^^^^

* Added a new flag ``viewport`` to the :class:`IsaacEnv` class to enable/disable rendering of the viewport.
  If the flag is set to ``True``, the viewport is enabled and the environment is rendered in the background.
* Updated the training scripts in the ``source/standalone/workflows`` directory to use the new flag ``viewport``.
  If the CLI argument ``--video`` is passed, videos are recorded in the ``videos`` directory using the
  :class:`gym.wrappers.RecordVideo` wrapper.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The :class:`IsaacEnv` class supports different rendering mode as referenced in OpenAI Gym's ``render`` method.
  These modes are:

  * ``rgb_array``: Renders the environment in the background and returns the rendered image as a numpy array.
  * ``human``: Renders the environment in the background and displays the rendered image in a window.

* Changed the constructor in the classes inheriting from :class:`IsaacEnv` to pass all the keyword arguments to the
  constructor of :class:`IsaacEnv` class.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Clarified the documentation of ``headless`` flag in the :class:`IsaacEnv` class. It refers to whether or not
  to render at every sim step, not whether to render the viewport or not.
* Fixed the unit tests for running random agent on included environments.

0.2.3 (2023-03-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Tuned the observations and rewards for ``Isaac-Lift-Franka-v0`` environment.

0.2.2 (2023-03-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed the issue with rigid object not working in the ``Isaac-Lift-Franka-v0`` environment.

0.2.1 (2023-03-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
^^^^^

* Added a flag ``disable_contact_processing`` to the :class:`SimCfg` class to handle
  contact processing effectively when using TensorAPIs for contact reporting.
* Added verbosity flag to :meth:`export_policy_as_onnx` to print model summary.

Fixed
^^^^^

* Clarified the documentation of flags in the :class:`SimCfg` class.
* Added enabling of ``omni.kit.viewport`` and ``omni.replicator.isaac`` extensions
  dynamically to maintain order in the startup of extensions.
* Corrected the experiment names in the configuration files for training environments with ``rsl_rl``.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Changed the default value of ``enable_scene_query_support`` in :class:`SimCfg` class to False.
  The flag is overridden to True inside :class:`IsaacEnv` class when running the simulation in
  non-headless mode.

0.2.0 (2023-01-25)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
^^^^^

* Added environment wrapper and sequential trainer for the skrl RL library
* Added training/evaluation configuration files for the skrl RL library

0.1.2 (2023-01-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Added the flag ``replicate_physics`` to the :class:`SimCfg` class.
* Increased the default value of ``gpu_found_lost_pairs_capacity`` in :class:`PhysxCfg` class

0.1.1 (2023-01-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug in ``Isaac-Velocity-Anymal-C-v0`` where the domain randomization is
  not applicable if cloning the environments with ``replicate_physics=True``.

0.1.0 (2023-01-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
^^^^^

* Initial release of the extension.
* Includes the following environments:

  * ``Isaac-Cartpole-v0``: A cartpole environment with a continuous action space.
  * ``Isaac-Ant-v0``: A 3D ant environment with a continuous action space.
  * ``Isaac-Humanoid-v0``: A 3D humanoid environment with a continuous action space.
  * ``Isaac-Reach-Franka-v0``: A end-effector pose tracking task for the Franka arm.
  * ``Isaac-Lift-Franka-v0``: A 3D object lift and reposing task for the Franka arm.
  * ``Isaac-Velocity-Anymal-C-v0``: An SE(2) velocity tracking task for legged robot on flat terrain.
