class NonHolonomicKinematicsGroup(ActuatorGroup):
    r"""
    An actuator group that formulates the 2D-base constraint for vehicle kinematics control.

    In simulation, it is easier to consider the mobile base as a floating link controlled by three dummy joints
    (prismatic joints along x and y, and revolute joint along z), in comparison to simulating wheels which is at times
    is tricky because of friction settings. Thus, this class implements the non-holonomic kinematic constraint for
    translating the input velocity command into joint velocity commands.

    A skid-steering base is under-actuated, i.e. the commands are forward velocity :math:`v_{B,x}` and the turning rate
    :\omega_{B,z}: in the base frame. Using the current base orientation, the commands are transformed into dummy
    joint velocity targets as:

    .. math::

        \dot{q}_{0, des} &= v_{B,x} \cos(\theta) \\
        \dot{q}_{1, des} &= v_{B,x} \sin(\theta) \\
        \dot{q}_{2, des} &= \omega_{B,z}

    where :math:`\theta` is the yaw of the 2-D base. Since the base is simulated as a dummy joint, the yaw is directly
    the value of the revolute joint along z, i.e., :math:`q_2 = \theta`.

    Tip:
        For velocity control of the base with dummy mechanism, we recommend setting high damping gains to the joints.
        This ensures that the base remains unperturbed from external disturbances, such as an arm mounted on the base.
