"""
This submodule provides marker utilities for simplifying creation of UI elements in the GUI.

Currently, the module provides two classes:

* :class:`StaticMarker` for creating a group of markers from a single USD file.
* :class:`PointMarker` for creating a group of spheres.


.. note::

    For some simple usecases, it may be sufficient to use the debug drawing utilities from Isaac Sim.
    The debug drawing API is available in the `omni.isaac.debug_drawing`_ module. It allows drawing of
    points and splines efficiently on the UI.
