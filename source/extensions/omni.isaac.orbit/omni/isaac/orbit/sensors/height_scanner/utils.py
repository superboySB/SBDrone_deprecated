    The terrain scan is approximated with a grid map of the input resolution.
    By default, we consider the origin as the center of the local map and the scan size ``(X, Y)`` is the
    map size. Given these settings, the elevation map spans from: ``(- X / 2, - Y / 2)`` to
    ``(+ X / 2, + Y / 2)``.

    Example:
        For a grid of size (0.2, 0.2) with resolution of 0.1, the created points will first x-axis fixed, while the
        y-axis changes, i.e.:
