    As of Python3.8, the standard dataclasses have two main issues which makes them non-generic for configuration use-cases.

    then Python throws an error requiring the usage of `default_factory`.

    Additionally, Python only explicitly checks for field specification when the type is a list, set or dict. This misses the
    use-case where the type is class itself. Thus, the code silently carries a bug with it which can lead to undesirable effects.
